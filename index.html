       <h2 class="intro-title titles">What is real estate?</h2>

       <p class="p-intro">Real estate is defined as the land and any permanent structures, like a home, or improvements attached to the land,
         whether natural or man-made.

        Real estate is a form of real property. It differs from personal property, which is not permanently attached to the land, such as vehicles, boats, jewelry, furniture, and farm equipment.

        <h2 class="mv-title">Market Value</h2>
          <p class="mv-p">An appraisal is an opinion or estimate regarding the value of a particular property
             as of a specific date. Appraisal reports are used by businesses, government agencies,
             individuals, investors, and mortgage companies when making decisions regarding real estate transactions.
             The goal of an appraisal is to determine a property's market value -
             the most probable price that the property will bring in a competitive and open market.<p>

            <p class="mv-p">
             Market price, the price at which property actually sells, may not always represent the market value.
             For example, if a seller is under duress because of the threat of foreclosure, or if a private sale is held, the property may sell below its market value.
